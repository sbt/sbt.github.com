           #### Hombrew ####

           #### By Hand installation ####
           First, download the [launcher jar](http://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-tools.sbt/sbt-launch/0.11.2/sbt-launch.jar) 
           and place it somewhere useful.
           THEN, create a script in that same directory.
           ##### Windows #####
           Create a `sbt.bat` file next to the launch jar.
           
               set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0
               java -Xmx512M -jar "%SCRIPT_DIR%sbt-launch.jar" %*
           
           Add the directory containing `sbt.bat` to the windows path.
           ##### Unix-Like #####
           Create a `sbt` script (a good place is `~/bin/sbt`
           
               java -Xmx512M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
           
           then make the script executable:
           
               $ chmod u+x ~/bin/sbt
